/**
  Fundraiser Exercise:
    Topics Covered: Data Types, Variables, User Input, and Math Operations

    Description:
    You're running the team's biweekly concession stand fundraiser to raise money for competitions, t-shirts, food, etc. 
    Write a program that asks the customer (user) for their order (only one type), and tells them the total cost of their items.
    These are the items your team is selling with prices: Hot Dog ($2), Water ($2), and Gatorade ($3.50). 
    These prices should be stored in your program.
    If the customer enters an unexpected value, your program should notify them and ask for another item until they respond with "Nevermind". 
    Terminate after a successful transaction.

    Output examples:
    ----------------
    EXAMPLE 1:
    What would you like to buy?

    How many would you like?

    That will be $7!
